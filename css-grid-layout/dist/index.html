		<title>A Complete Guide to Grid</title>
		<details>
			CSS Grid Layout is the most powerful layout system available in CSS. It is a 2-dimensional system, meaning it can handle both columns and rows, unlike flexbox which is largely a 1-dimensional system. You work with Grid Layout by applying CSS rules both to a parent element ( which becomes the Grid Container ) and to that elements children (which become Grid ltems)

			<title>Introduction</title>

				<p>CSS Grid Layout (aka "Grid"), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based user interfaces. CSS has always been used to lay out our web pages, but it's never done a very good job of it. First we used tables, then floats, positioning and inline-block, but all of these methods were essentially hacks and left out a lot of important functionality (vertical centering, for instance). Flexbox helped out, but it's intended for simple one-dimensional layouts, not complex two-dimensional ones (Flexbox and Frid actually work very well togethor). Grid is the first CSS module created specially to solve the layout problems we've all been hacking our way around for as long as we've been making websites.</p>

			<title>Important Terminology</title>

				Before diving into the concepts of Grid it's important to understand the terminology. Since the terms onvolved here are all kinda conceptually similar, it's easy to confuse them with one another if you don't first memorize their meanings defined by the Grid specification. But don't worry, there aren't many of them.
